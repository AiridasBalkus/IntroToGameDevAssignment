    <h2>Opening Scene</h2>
    <p>On a clear evening, with a red sky, we see a car driving down the N30, showing us the right side of the car. A local radio station can be heard describing the horrors of the aftermath of the riots within Enniscorthy.  We see John’s cold stare in the rearview mirror. After a few minutes of driving John ends up parking in the local Pub. </p>

    <h2>The Bar</h2>
    <p>John confidently strides towards the barman, with all the locals giving him a strange look. Garda sirens can be heard within the pub the muffled sound putting fear within the locals’ eyes. As john sits at the bar with his pint of Guiness the barman gives him 2 options for places to search. A small local café or Treacy’s hotel. </p>

    <h2>Enniscorthy Castle</h2>
    <p>John and Anothy go to the castle to investigate he finds a group of gardaí planning their next move who to kill, and how to stop the investigation. John and Anthony sneak up and initiate a fight, however neither side have guns, so it just becomes a bloody fist fight 5 vs 2. John and Anothy come out on top, arresting the corrupt gardaí. </p>

    <h2>Cliffside</h2>
    <p>After getting the clues he needed from Enniscorthy castle John makes it to the cliffside, where he is assisted by the rookie. A battle ensues with the ending depending on some choices the player has made. Weather is dependent on endings (Ending 1 having a stormy night whereas Ending 2 having a clear moonlit night). </p>
